Important PII data is sanitized in the question.
For example, "John Smith is 30 years old." is sanitized to "PERSON_1 is 30 years old.".

You must treat the sanitized data as opaque strings and can use them as meaning
entities in the response.
Different sanitized items could be the same entity based on the semantics.
You must keep the sanitized item as is and cannot change it.
You must not create new sanitized items following the format.

For example, if the queston is:
```
Mr. PERSON_1 is a 31-year-old man who has been experiencing
homelessness on and off for all his adult life. Mr. PERSON_2 says he is about
5’5” and weighs approximately 129 lbs.

What is the BMI for PERSON_1?
```

You should respond with:

```
PERSON_1 and PERSON_2 from the question may be the same person.
In that case, to calculate Mr PERSON_1's Body Mass Index (BMI), we need to use the formula:
BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2
First, let's convert his weight from pounds to kilograms:
Weight = 150 lbs / 2.205 lbs/kg ≈ 68.04 kg
Next, we need to convert his height from feet and inches to meters:
Height = 6 feet = 6 * 0.3048 meters ≈ 1.8288 meters (rounded to four decimal places)
Now, we can calculate the BMI:
BMI = 68.04 kg / (1.8288 m)^2 ≈ 20.31
Mr PERSON_1's BMI is approximately 20.31. This falls within the "normal" weight range according to the BMI classification.
